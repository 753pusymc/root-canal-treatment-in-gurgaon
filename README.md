What is Root Canal Treatment (RCT)?  A Root Canal Treatment (also called endodontic therapy) is a dental procedure designed to save a tooth whose inner pulp — containing nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue — has become infected or inflamed. Without treatment, the infection can spread, causing pain, swelling, or an abscess.
